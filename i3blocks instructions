[9:24 PM] Kurolox: How does it look?
[9:24 PM] Kurolox: Send me a screenshot
[9:28 PM] Kurolox: Well, I'm going to sleep. If the stuff from the top right is missing, check that you have installed i3blocks
[9:29 PM] Kurolox: also check at the part of the config that says i3 Bar, and there should be a line that looks like this
[9:29 PM] Kurolox: status_command i3blocks -c ~/Temple-of-Edfu/.config/i3/i3blocks/config
[9:29 PM] Kurolox: you change that route to where you have the i3blocks stuff, it should be ~/.config/i3/i3blocks/config(edited)
[9:30 PM] Kurolox: Also each part of the bar might need their own dependencies. Check them by clicking in the ones you will use. The dependencies are commented. https://github.com/Kurolox/Temple-of-Edfu/tree/master/.config/i3/i3blocks/blocks
